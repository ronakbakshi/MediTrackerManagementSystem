# MediTrackerManagementSystem
Medi Tracker Management System helps users to find out the hospitals present in a city and also to view the list of doctors provided in that particular hospital. This allows users to search for the specialized doctors in the city and the availability time. Only registered users are allowed to take the appointment with the concerned doctors. There will be 3 roles, namely useable, admin and doctor.
